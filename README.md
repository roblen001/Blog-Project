This blog site was designed and coded in a tight time frame for fun :) It uses Gatsby JS and Strapi.

It was created to practice web developement using GatsbyJS.

After learning about Gastby Js I wanted to put my skills to the test and develop a blog site which utilized Gatsby Js this project does just that. Since the Formula1 season was coming to a start I decided to create a sample formula 1 blog site. I gave myself a tight timeframe to complete this project to make it even more challenging. I have written a blog post about the workflow I used to build this site if you are interested in my thought process while designing basic websites.
